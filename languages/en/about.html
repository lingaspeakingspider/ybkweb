                    We are a club that enables students to use the school's laboratories more 
                    effectively and frequently and encourages students who are interested in various
                    branches of biology (microbiology, molecular biology, physiology, medicine, 
                    zoology, botany, ecology, biochemistry, bioinformatics, etc.) to develop projects 
                    in their fields. Students developing projects; finding colleagues who are 
                    interested in the same subject, managing the project process, writing a project 
                    report, scanning the scientific literature, developing hypotheses, benefiting from 
                    previous studies, etc. We provide guidance on issues. In addition, those who want 
                    to improve their general biology knowledge; TÜBİTAK Olympics, AP, IB, SAT, YKS etc. 
                    We support students who are preparing for exams or studying to participate in 
                    competitions during their scientific preparations. We ensure that students develop 
                    a positive understanding not only of biology but also of the entire scientific 
                    community, and thus become individuals interested in science, learning and 
                    research. With social activities, we enable students to develop the teamwork, 
                    process management, group communication and leadership skills they will need in 
                    business life. Finally, to bring students together with academics and other 
                    researchers who are experts in their fields of science so that they can benefit 
                    from their knowledge and experience.
