                We are a student-led volunteer organization that enable students at NTNU to develop 
                themselves both as engineers and team members. This is possible by designing and 
                building both the hardware and software of our own autonomous underwater/surface 
                vehicles (AUV/ASV) and remotely operated vessels (ROV) which we then compete with 
                nationally and internationally.
