                        PDAC is a type of cancer known for its aggressive nature and limited treatment options. In this study, the use of Conivaptan Hydrochloride as an inhibitor against Lactate Metabolism and the immunosuppressive system in PDAC Cancer was investigated. Symbiotic relationship between glycolytic and oxidative cells in PDAC cancer, It strengthens cancer tissue and makes it more aggressive (Wang et al., 2021). Lactate balance disrupted as a result of MCT1 and MCT4 inhibition affects both intracellular acidity and ATP metabolism, which affects the development of cancerous tissues. It is expected to stop or even destroy it. Additionally, in various types of cancer, the TIM3/Galectin-9 signaling pathway has been shown to suppress the anti-tumor immune response by restricting T cell function (Wolf et al., 2020), and the cancer with the highest TIM3 expression is pancreatic cancer, including PDAC (Lim et al. , 2024). Inhibition of TIM3 protein, which is highly expressed by CD8+ and CD4+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment, would abrogate the immunosuppressive response by preventing TIM3/Gal9 interaction. Virtual medicine made in line with these hypotheses Conivaptan Hydrochloride, which we obtained through scanning; It has been evaluated as an inhibitor of MCT1, MCT4 and TIM3.
